github intro

I'm moving from cvs/subversion to GitHub.

This web interface reminds me of TRAC, from one of my old jobs.

I've gone throught the Pro GIT book a few times and have a git-daemon(freeBSD), and a shared repo on Ubuntu.

I'm trying to combine my self-hosted repo with a local JIRA, (CentOS7), and get them, (me), to play nice with github/bitbucket.

Still not sure of Ubuntu's services.  GIT Pro describes and "upstart" init script but Ubuntu has just left upstart init scripts to use systemd from centOS7.  There's a descripton and example on stackoverflow of the /etc/systemd/systemd/ that I can't get to work.
